# Famsite (working name)

The aim of this project is to create a simple board-based system for families to be able to customise to their needs. Each board will allow the insertion of pre-made 'modules' for displaying and altering things such as shopping lists and group chats. 

Currently, modules include todo lists and a basic chat. Users with an account can create boards, and then add other users to their board with the other user's user ID.

The app is hosted at https://famsite.benbraham.com
