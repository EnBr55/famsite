# Famsite (working name)

The aim of this project is to create a simple board-based system for families to be able to customise to their needs. Each board will allow the insertion of pre-made 'modules' for displaying and altering things such as shopping lists and group chats. In this sense, the app will mimic pre-existing services such as Atlassian's *trello*, but with the target being families, rather than creators.
