# Famsite (working name)

The aim of this project is to create a simple board-based system for groups to be able to customise to their needs. Each board will allow the creation of pre-made 'modules' for displaying and altering things such as shopping lists and group chats. 

Currently, modules include todo lists and a chat - with support for sending/receiving images. Users can be searched for and added to a board that you are a member of.

The app is currently hosted at https://famsite.benbraham.com
